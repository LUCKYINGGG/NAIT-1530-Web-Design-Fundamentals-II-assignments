Notes:

Your Instructor will provide the first media query stop and the hover effect
on the primary navigation.

The three images in the Modal window(boa, sweater & sunglasses) do not
display in the small view.

The dropdown navigation in the small view “Does not need to work!”.

 The first media query stop is at [ Instructor Provided ] pixels (The small view
ends), then the page gracefully scale up to 1600 pixels and then is 
constrained in the viewport center at larger widths. 

The nav of the main page is sticky.

The “More New Arrivals You’ll Love” section contains a horizontal navigation 
component that contains twelve items.  Please duplicate the six provided.

The “Privacy Policy” link in the modal window and in the footer should
open the “Privacy.html” page.

The Privacy page displays a long ream of textual content.  It does not require
any further formatting than what is described in the provided view.  The text in
the small view will fill 90% of the viewport.

The “Return to Home” link on the privacy page should open the Index page
and is in a fixed position in the viewport.  It will be on top of the text in the
small view.

The background of the Privacy page fills the full screen and is fixed in position
(Parallax).
